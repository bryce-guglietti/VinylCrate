# VinylCrate
A JavaScript Application that utilizes PHP to connect to a SQL database holding users information, Vinyl collections, and more

## What I used
Utilized HTML, JS, and PHP for updating and viewing record collections

Users are able to sort by their own album rankings, artists, and album names.

PHP handles logins, changes in the collections, viewing collections, and more.

Users passwords are encrypted and hidden. 

## Notes
This application is not finished and is not yet deployed

Social aspect of adding friends is a future update.
